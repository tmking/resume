  %h2 About
  %p.lead I help people solve their business problems by working with them to create comprehensive web-based solutions.
  %p My primarily tools are Ruby, Rails, and Javascript. I've worked with all of the major SQL databases, as well as some of the popular no-SQL options. I am also completely proficient in HTML, CSS, and jQuery (as well as HAML, SASS, and Cofeescript). In short: I do both backend and frontend development.
  %p Additionally, I have extensive experience with Agile methodologies and working on distributed teams. I'm also adept at shell scripting and UNIX systems administration.
  %p My professional goal is to work in environments in which I can employ the full gamut of these skills, alongside people who value thorough planning, meticulous execution, and good communication.

  %h4= link_to 'Over & Under', 'http://overandunderonline.com/'
  %p Over &amp; Under is a retailer that sells custom cushions for outdoor furniture. Their web application had been abandoned and was running woefully outdated versions of Rails and #{link_to 'Spree', 'http://spreecommerce.com'}. I took it on as a rescue project (I have a soft spot for these) and, after performing a taxing upgrade, I've been leading the development of new features and gradually implementing a complete redesign.
  %h4= link_to 'Rent Range', 'http://rentrange.com/'
  %p (Currentinly in progress). This project was a Rails rewrite of a PHP application. My colleagues and I had to integrate several different feeds of housing data, integrate them in a local database, and then write a reporting framework to enable users and administrators to perform various kinds of analysis on the data.
  %h4= link_to 'MDLogix', 'http://mdlogix.com/solutions/crms-clinical-research-management-system'
  %p I contracted with MDLogix for a year and a half, developing and refactoring their Clinical Research Management System application. The most significant project I worked on was a series of APIs designed to integrate with a business partner's .NET application. I also led development of a major insurance-related module for Johns Hopkins.
  %h4= link_to "Jordan Kitt's Music", 'http://jordankitts.com/'
  %p Jordan Kitt's is the east coast's largest piano retailer. I wrote and maintain a Rails application that functions as a backend to the company's family of retail sites and handles internal weblead routing. I also provide support for most of the company's IT infrastructure.
